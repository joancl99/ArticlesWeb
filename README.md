# Articles Web
This website, created in HTML and CSS, is part of my basic learning in web development and learning about HTML. It is a simple website with an index, a section of articles about video games, and a very basic form section.

# My Learning Goals
- Practice HTML structure and semantics.
- Use CSS to style a website.
- Organize a small project with multiple pages.
- Manage version control with Git/GitHub.
- Deploy a website using GitHub Pages.

# Features
- It can be navigated using a web browser through the three sections: **Inicio**, **Art√≠culos**, and **Contacto**.  
Clicking on any of these links will take you to the corresponding page.
- Articles section with content about video games.
- Basic form page for user interaction.
- Simple, clean layout using HTML and CSS only.
- Images and styles organized in folders for clarity.
- The **Contacto** section is simple. You just need to fill in your details, which include: your first name, last name, email, age, and the message you want to send.  
1. If any field is left empty, a red warning message appears indicating that it must be filled.  
2. Once the field is filled, the red warning disappears.  
3. The **Email** and **Age** fields have validation:  
4. The email must be in a valid format.  
5. The age must be a number between 1 and 120.
